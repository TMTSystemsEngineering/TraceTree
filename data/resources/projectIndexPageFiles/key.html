  <h2 align="center">Key to Trace Tree Diagrams</h2>
  <p>The rectangles representing requirements are colored as follows:</p>
<DL compact>
  <DT>Yellow</DT><DD>The requirement that is the subject of this 
                  page</DD>
  <DT>Blue</DT><DD>Requirements that flow down to or from the subject
                  requirement, and have Object Text modification dates 
                  earlier or later, respectively, than the subject 
		  requirement's Object Text modfication date, i.e. 
		  <b>conforms to ideal time</b>.</DD>
  <DT>Red</DT><DD>Requirements, either upstream or downstream, that have 
                  Object Text modification dates later or earlier, 
                  respectively, than the subject requirement's Object 
		  Text modification date, i.e., <b>does not conform to 
		  ideal time</b>.</DD>
  <DT>Any color with Red Outline</DT><DD>Red outline 
                  indicates that this requirement's Object Text 
                  modification date is unknown, and has been replaced 
                  with its module's latest baseline date for purposes of 
                  comparison with other requirements (see Red and pink 
                  below)</DD>
  <DT>Pink</DT><DD>Same as red, except that the up- or downstream 
                   object's modification date is based on the its 
                   module's most recent baseline date instead of that of 
                   its Object Text (indicates that the most recent 
                   baseline happened more recently than the most recent 
                   modification date of the requirement).</DD>
</DL>
<p>The idea behind the red and pink markings is that a higher level 
requirement should have an earlier modification date than a lower level 
requirement, given that flowdown has occurred in the expected top to 
bottom order.  Of course, this doesn't always hold, and sometimes for 
good reason.  <i>Caveat emptor</i>.</p>

<p>Baselining of a module wipes out the individual histories of the 
requirements in a module.  The history can be obtained by opening 
previous baselines in DOORS, but this action is prohibitively difficult 
when done in bulk as is the case for the production of this trace 
tree.</p>
