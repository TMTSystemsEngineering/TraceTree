<h3><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a></h3>

<p>
This website is intended to provide a quick, 
graphical way of navigating among all of the requirements 
recorded in DOORS for a project.  The DOORS client itself, while 
powerful, is limited in its support for understanding and tracing the 
requirements flow along the links recorded in the database.  It is also 
sometimes very slow, operationally, to show or trace linked requirements.
</p>
<p>
The Trace Tree provides the ability to trace up and down the links from 
any given requirement in the database.  The requirements linked upward 
and downward are traced as far as possible from each given requirement, 
and displayed graphically.  Each requirement in a project has its own web 
page in the Trace Tree.  
Requirements in a graph are shown as rectangular blocks in the graph, 
with various colors coding information about the requirements.  Aside 
from the subject requirement (depicted in yellow), each requirement 
block is clickable, allowing easy navigation from the subject's page to 
the page of any other requirement on the graph. The blocks are generally 
arranged from left to right, with the left-most blocks representing the 
highest-level requirements.
</p>

<h3><a name="Caveat">Caveat</a></h3>
<p>
  <i>These pages must not be used as definitive!</i> They are meant 
  solely as an aide, or tool, in dealing with the requirements.  Only 
  the DOORS database itself is completely up-to-date and contains all 
  information related to requirements and the flowdown.  Please see 
  further <a href="#caveat">explanation below</a> for information on 
  what is and is not included in these pages.
</p>

<h3><a name="How">Generation and Updates</a></h3>
The Trace Tree website is first generated by dumping the all of the data from 
a given project into a separate database, then building the website 
from that. Updates thereafter are incremental, with only those objects that have changed
being dumped to the database and subsequently written to the website.  Any change 
to any attribute or object text or links will cause the pages for that object to be updated.  
(This is a change as of September 2013; previously, only a change to an attribute that was 
set to affect the object's "Last Modified On" parameter would cause an object to be updated.)
</p>
<p>
A consequence of this is that a module or entire project that is not getting any changes will not
be updated at all, and it may appear that the Trace Tree reports are not being run.
</p>
<p>
Updates are routinely made once per day, in the early morning around 4:00 AM, and completing in an hour or so.  
Therefore, edits made to the DOORS project during the day will appear in the Trace Tree the next day.
</p>


<h3><a name="Whatis">What is a Requirement?</a></h3>
<p>
  Formerly, the trace trees eliminated certain types of objects such as 
  table cells, or text with no "shall" in them.  Now, however, almost 
  every object in a DOORS module is included.  Only deleted requirements 
  are excluded; this is true even if the DOORS default view shows deleted 
  requirements.
</p>


<h3><a name="Three">Three Types of Pages</a></h3>
<p>
  There are two levels of index for each project, and then a web page for 
  each DOORS object, or requirement.<br>
  <img src="explanationFigure1.png"><br>
  The home page of a project's site lists each module and 
  its description.  Each module listed is hyperlinked to its own module index, 
  which shows a view of the module similar to a "book" view as produced by DOORS.  
  In this view, the object ID of each requirement is clickable and is linked its own web page.
</p>
<p>In the individual module view, it is possible to 
  add attributes in columns to the right of the requirement text, but 
  this must be set up in advance and is not changeable from the web 
  page.  Please <a href="mailto:gtrancho@tmt.org">e-mail 
  me</a> to make this happen.
</p>
<p>
Each individual requirement page shows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the graphical tree of objects linked to the subject requirement;</li>
  <li>information about the date and time that the page was generated;</li>
  <li>the modification date of the subject requirement;</li>
  <li>a link directly into DOORS (if you are running the web browswer on 
      a machine with an installed DOORS client);</li>
  <li>Object Heading, if any</li>
  <li>Object Short Text, if any</li>
  <li>the Object Text (the requirement text itself), if any, with the 
      pictures, excel tables, and other OLE objects; and</li>
  <li><u>most</u> of the attributes, but without graphics and such.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="caveat">
<h3><a name="ModificationDates">On  Modification Dates</a></h3>
<p>
  Requirement modification date and times are used both textually and 
  graphically to illustrate the timeliness of flowdown.  Ideally, a 
  requirement change starts at a high level and is followed in time by a 
  response at each lower level.  For example, one would expect that a 
  change in the Project System Requirement Document (usually Level 2) would be 
  followed at a future date by changes in at Level 3 (e.g. the Flight System), then 
  the Level 4, and so on.  Of course there are many 
  reasons why this ideal situation may not hold.  The purpose is to flag 
  violations in the rule without making judgements as to whether there 
  is a valid reason for it.
</p>
<p>
  The graphical presentation of such violations is a red or pink box 
  color for the traced requirement.  A red or pink box indicates that 
  the requirement's modification date is either later than the subject's 
  date for an "upstream" requirement, or earlier for a downstream 
  requirement.  The comparison is <u>always</u> done with respect to the 
  subject (yellow) requirement's date, not with any requirements which 
  might be between them in the flowdown. <br>
  <img src="explanationFigure2.png">
  </p>
  <p>Modfication Date/Time is 
  complicated by how DOORS stores this information.  For each object, 
  the "Object Text" attribute's most recent modification date/time is 
  used preferentially (other attributes' history is ignored).  If never 
  modified, the object's creation date is used.  However, if the object 
  was created or modified <i>previous to the most recent baseline of the 
  module</i>, then the module baseline date is used instead.  This is 
  because DOORS does not keep history from previous baselines of a 
  module.  (To obtain previous history, every baseline of every module 
  would have to be kept open, a prohibitive operation.) </p> <p>
  Requirements for which the modification date is actually the module 
  baseline date are shown in pink rather than red if the date violates 
  flowdown.  If the subject requirement's modfication date is actually 
  its module's baseline date, its yellow box is outlined in red.
</p>
<h3><a name="TextAttrCaveat">Presentation of Text and Attributes, and a Caveat</a></h3>
<p>
  On both the module pages and on the object pages, some modification of 
  the text has necessarily taken place in order to preserve some 
  formatting under HTML rules.  This includes:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Line breaks have been preserved.</li>
  <li>Use of tabs anywhere in the text except as an initial indent 
      <i>used to cause</i> an HTML table to be built on the assumption 
      that the tabs were used to align columns of text.  <i>This is 
      currently no longer true</i>, so tab-character-generated tables 
      may be rather compressed and their columns no longer 
      straight.</li>
  <li>OLE Objects, such as Excel tables and pictures, are now included 
      in the Requirement Text (Object Text), though not in attributes or 
      Object Headings. Please <a 
      href="mailto:gtrancho@tmt.org">e-mail me</a> if you 
      detect any problems with the translation.</li>
  <li>Rich Text, including colors, bold, italics, underlines, 
      superscripts, subscripts, and greek characters, is now included, 
      though not in attributes or Object Headings. Again, lease <a 
      href="mailto:gtrancho@tmt.org">e-mail me</a> if you 
      detect any problems with the translation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The upshot of this reformatting is that <i>these pages must not be 
  used as definitive!</i> They are meant solely as an aide, or tool, in 
  dealing with the requirements.
</p>
<h3><a name="Bugs">Two Known Bugs</a></h3>
<p>Two known bugs exist.  Of course there may be others.<br>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Some trace trees are enormous, with hundreds of objects and links depicted.  
Occasionally they are so large that the graphic engine takes it upon itself
to scale the image down.  However, it doesn't scale the image map, and so the
graphic is not properly clickable (not to mention difficult to read).  In these 
cases, the graphic is simply omitted, but there is no mention of why.</li>
<li>DOORS does not always use conventional encodings of characters.  Every effort 
made to handle these properly, but occasionally a particular case has been missed.
Please <a href="mailto:gtrancho@tmt.org">
e-mail me</a> if you find any of these.
</li>
</ol>
